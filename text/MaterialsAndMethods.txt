# Methods

Sonuçlar sürekli değişkenler için ortalama, ortanca, standart sapma, en düşük ve en büyük değerler olarak, kategorik değişkenler için sayı ve yüzde olarak verildi.

Son tanıya göre 4 gruba ayrılan olgularda sürekli değişkenlerdeki farklılık Kruskall-Wallis testi ile, kategorik değişkenlerdeki oranlar arasındaki farklılık Pearson Ki-kare testi ile değerlendirildi.

İstatistik analizler R version 3.5.1 programı ve tangram paketi ile yapıldı. p<0.05 değeri anlamlı olarak kabul edildi.

All results were presented as mean and standard deviation(SD) for continuous
variables and as number and percentage for categorical variables. Normality of Numerical
variables was tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Numerical data with normal distribution
was analyzed by Independent Samples t test while data with skewed distribution were
analyzed by Mann Whitney U test. Categorical variables were presented as percentages and
analyzed by Chi-square test.
The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine any statistically
significant differences among more than two independent (unrelated) groups for normal
distribution.and Kruskal-Wallis is used to describe for abnormal distribution One-way
ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test is used to assess for significant differences on a continuous
dependent variable by a categorical independent variable for more than two groups,(Normal
and abnormal distribution, respectively). Tukey test was used to compare the differences
between the parametric variables. Dwass-Steel-Critchlow-Fligner test was used to compare
the differences between the non-parametric variables for differences between the groups.
Pearson Chi-Square test was used to compare the differences between categorical variables.
Pearson(normal distribution) and Spearman(abnormal distribution) correlation analysis was
used to evaluate the relationship between variables.
