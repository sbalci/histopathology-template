## Define Variable Types



**Codes for defining variable types**.^[See [`childRmd/_06variableTypes.Rmd`](https://github.com/sbalci/histopathology-template/blob/master/childRmd/_06variableTypes.Rmd) file for other codes]


### Find Key Columns


**print column names as vector**



```r
dput(names(mydata))
```

```
c("ID", "Name", "Sex", "Age", "Race", "PreinvasiveComponent", 
"LVI", "PNI", "LastFollowUpDate", "Death", "Group", "Grade", 
"TStage", "Anti-X-intensity", "Anti-Y-intensity", "LymphNodeMetastasis", 
"Valid", "Smoker", "Grade_Level", "SurgeryDate", "DeathTime")
```


#### Find ID and key columns to exclude from analysis


See the code as function in [`R/find_key.R`](https://github.com/sbalci/histopathology-template/blob/master/R/find_key.R). 



```r
keycolumns <- mydata %>% sapply(., FUN = dataMaid::isKey) %>% as_tibble() %>% select(which(.[1, 
    ] == TRUE)) %>% names()
keycolumns
```

```
[1] "ID"   "Name"
```


### Variable Types

**Get variable types**


```r
mydata %>% select(-keycolumns) %>% inspectdf::inspect_types()
```

```
# A tibble: 4 x 4
  type             cnt  pcnt col_name  
  <chr>          <int> <dbl> <list>

3 numeric            3  15.8 <chr [3]>

```




```r

# Results

**Write results as described in [@Knijn2015]**^[From Table 1: Proposed items for reporting histopathology studies. Recommendations for reporting histopathology studies: a proposal Virchows Arch (2015) 466:611â€“615 DOI 10.1007/s00428-015-1762-3]

- Describe the number of patients included in the analysis and reason for dropout

- Report patient/disease characteristics (including the biomarker of interest) with the number of missing values

- Describe the interaction of the biomarker of interest with established prognostic variables

- Include at least 90 % of initial cases included in univariate and multivariate analyses

- Report the estimated effect (relative risk/odds ratio, confidence interval, and p value) in univariate analysis

- Report the estimated effect (hazard rate/odds ratio, confidence interval, and p value) in multivariate analysis

- Report the estimated effects (hazard ratio/odds ratio, confidence interval, and p value) of other prognostic factors included in multivariate analysis

- Intracranial WHO grade I meningioma: a competing risk analysis of progression and disease-specific survival

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00701-019-04096-9




**Calculate survival time**


```r
mydata$int <- lubridate::interval(lubridate::ymd(mydata$SurgeryDate), lubridate::ymd(mydata$LastFollowUpDate))
mydata$OverallTime <- lubridate::time_length(mydata$int, "month")
mydata$OverallTime <- round(mydata$OverallTime, digits = 1)
```




**recode death status outcome as numbers for survival analysis**

<!-- alive 0, death 1, punch cards -->

<!-- reference to addin -->



```r
## Recoding mydata$Death into mydata$Outcome
mydata$Outcome <- forcats::fct_recode(as.character(mydata$Death), `1` = "TRUE", `0` = "FALSE")
mydata$Outcome <- as.numeric(as.character(mydata$Outcome))
```

**it is always a good practice to double-check after recoding**^[[JAMA retraction after miscoding â€“ new Finalfit function to check recoding](https://www.datasurg.net/2019/10/15/jama-retraction-after-miscoding-new-finalfit-function-to-check-recoding/)]
