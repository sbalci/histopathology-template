**Setup global chunk settings**^[Change `echo = FALSE` to hide codes after knitting and Change `cache = TRUE` to knit quickly. Change `error=TRUE` to continue rendering while errors are present.]



```r

    cache = TRUE,
    comment = NA,
    tidy = TRUE,

    fig.height = 4
)
```



```r

knit_hooks$set(output = function(x, options) {
    # this hook is used only when the linewidth option is not NULL
    if (!is.null(n <- options$linewidth)) {
        x = knitr:::split_lines(x)
        # any lines wider than n should be wrapped
        if (any(nchar(x) > n)) 
            x = strwrap(x, width = n)
        x = paste(x, collapse = "\n")

## Define Variable Types



**Codes for defining variable types**.^[See [`childRmd/_06variableTypes.Rmd`](https://github.com/sbalci/histopathology-template/blob/master/childRmd/_06variableTypes.Rmd) file for other codes]




**print column names as vector**



```r
dput(names(mydata))
```

```
c("ID", "Name", "Sex", "Age", "Race", "PreinvasiveComponent", 
"LVI", "PNI", "LastFollowUpDate", "Death", "Group", "Grade", 
"TStage", "AntiX_intensity", "AntiY_intensity", "LymphNodeMetastasis", 
"Valid", "Smoker", "Grade_Level", "SurgeryDate", "DeathTime")
```

### Find Key Columns

#### Find ID and key columns to exclude from analysis

```
vctrs::vec_assert()

dplyr::all_equal()

arsenal::compare()

visdat::vis_compare()

```

See the code as function in [`R/find_key.R`](https://github.com/sbalci/histopathology-template/blob/master/R/find_key.R). 



```r
keycolumns <- mydata %>% sapply(., FUN = dataMaid::isKey) %>% tibble::as_tibble() %>% 
    dplyr::select(which(.[1, ] == TRUE)) %>% names()
keycolumns
```

```
[1] "ID"   "Name"
```


### Variable Types

**Get variable types**


```r
mydata %>% dplyr::select(-keycolumns) %>% inspectdf::inspect_types()
```

```
# A tibble: 4 x 4
  type             cnt  pcnt col_name  
  <chr>          <int> <dbl> <list>

### Define Variable Types


#### Find `character` variables


```r
characterVariables <- mydata %>% dplyr::select(-keycolumns) %>% inspectdf::inspect_types() %>% 
    dplyr::filter(type == "character") %>% dplyr::select(col_name) %>% dplyr::pull() %>% 
    unlist()

characterVariables
```

```
 [1] "Sex"                  "Race"                 "PreinvasiveComponent"
 [4] "LVI"                  "PNI"                  "Group"

# Statistical Analysis

**Learn these tests as highlighted in [@Schmidt2017].**^[Statistical Literacy Among Academic Pathologists: A Survey Study to Gauge Knowledge of Frequently Used Statistical Tests Among Trainees and Faculty. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine: February 2017, Vol. 141, No. 2, pp. 279-287. https://doi.org/10.5858/arpa.2016-0200-OA]

# Results

**Write results as described in [@Knijn2015]**^[From Table 1: Proposed items for reporting histopathology studies. Recommendations for reporting histopathology studies: a proposal Virchows Arch (2015) 466:611â€“615 DOI 10.1007/s00428-015-1762-3 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4460276/]



- Describe the number of patients included in the analysis and reason for dropout

- Report patient/disease characteristics (including the biomarker of interest) with the number of missing values

- Describe the interaction of the biomarker of interest with established prognostic variables

- Include at least 90 % of initial cases included in univariate and multivariate analyses

- Report the estimated effect (relative risk/odds ratio, confidence interval, and p value) in univariate analysis

- Report the estimated effect (hazard rate/odds ratio, confidence interval, and p value) in multivariate analysis

- Report the estimated effects (hazard ratio/odds ratio, confidence interval, and p value) of other prognostic factors included in multivariate analysis
